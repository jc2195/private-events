# Private Events

The goal of this project is to build the framework of a site similar to a private Eventbrite on Rails, which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events. Events take place at a specific date and at a location. A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.

The site has no styling, it is just plain HTML. The goal was to build a working scaffold of a site.

This project was made as a solution to the following The Odin Project - Ruby on Rails - ASSOCIATIONS task: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations?ref=lnav
