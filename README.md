# Private Events

The goal of this project is to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite on Rails, which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location. A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
